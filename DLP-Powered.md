The DLP Manifesto
Symbolic Worlds, Not Assets
1. The Premise

Large Language Models are not assistants. They are not chatbots. They are not tools glued onto existing software.

They are a new class of processor.

We call them DLPs — Digital Language Processors.

Just as CPUs process numbers and GPUs process vectors, DLPs process symbols, structure, and meaning.

Software that treats them otherwise will always feel bolted-on.

2. The Core Mistake

Most systems try to force DLPs to:

look at pixels

reason over blobs

parse opaque assets

operate after the fact

This is like asking a GPU to parse JSON.

It works — but it is wrong.

3. The Correct Substrate

DLPs operate best on:

symbols

grammars

diffs

intents

constraints

Therefore, the world itself must be symbolic.

Not descriptions of the world. Not screenshots of the world.

The world.

4. Glyphs Are Blocks

A glyph is not text.

A glyph is:

a tile

a block

a pixel cluster

a semantic atom

A grid of glyphs is a world.

This is not ASCII nostalgia. This is addressable reality.

Minecraft used cubes. We use symbols.

5. Fonts Are ROM

Spritesheets are assets. Fonts are indexed memory.

When every tile is a glyph:

the font is the tileset

the screen is VRAM

strings are draw calls

This is not metaphor. This is architecture.

6. Worlds Must Be Diffable

DLPs do not need frames. They need changes.

A single glyph mutation is more meaningful than a megapixel redraw.

State is:

a grid

plus diffs

plus history

Nothing more.

7. Audio Is Intent, Not Files

Sound is not an asset.

Sound is:

impact

motion

tension

release

DLPs emit audio intent. Speech engines and DSP render it.

Language becomes sound.

8. Art Is Manufactured

Humans should not draw 3,800 tiles.

They should define:

grammars

palettes

edge rules

constraints

AI fills the lattice.

This is not creativity loss. This is leverage.

9. This Is a Demake — and an Upgrade

Like LEGO games. Like Minecraft. Like early consoles.

Reducing fidelity increases composability.

Symbolic worlds scale where realism collapses.

10. The Future Is Obvious in Hindsight

Hardware DLPs will exist.

When they do:

symbolic systems will accelerate

asset-heavy systems will stall

Software written for DLPs today will simply get faster.

11. The Claim

This is not a genre. Not a style. Not a gimmick.

It is a computational alignment.

Software should match the processors it runs on.

DLPs demand symbolic worlds.

12. The Invitation

If this sounds strange, it is because the category is new.

If it sounds obvious, it is because it is.

Build worlds made of symbols. Let language compute reality.

The rest will follow.

This is not text games.
This is not AI art.

This is DLP-native software.
